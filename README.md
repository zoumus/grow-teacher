# Welcome to grow-teacher

Teachers in public schools need to use their personal finances to make up for the lack of school materials that their students need. It's not right. Although just a stop gap for this issue, [Grow teacher](https://grow-teacher.herokuapp.com/login) allows teachers to create posts with a funding goal and equipment checklist. Parents can either make a direct donation or pick up the supplies and give them directly to the teacher, checking that item off from the post adding to the funding goal.
